Node.js version management: no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted API, just **simple**.

(Unfortunately `n` is not supported on Windows yet. If you're able to make it work, send in a pull request!)

## Installation

Since you probably already have `node`, the easiest way to install `n` is through `npm`:

    $ npm install -g n

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and

    $ make install

to install `n` to `bin/n` of the directory specified in the environment variable `$PREFIX`, which defaults to `/usr/local` (note that you will likely need to use `sudo`). To install `n` in a custom location (such as `$CUSTOM_LOCATION/bin/n`), run `PREFIX=$CUSTOM_LOCATION make install`.

Once installed, `n` installs `node` versions to subdirectory `n/versions` of the directory specified in environment variable `N_PREFIX`, which defaults to `/usr/local`; the _active_ `node`/`iojs` version is installed directly in `N_PREFIX`.
To change the default to, say, `$HOME`, prefix later calls to `n` with `N_PREFIX=$HOME ` or add `export N_PREFIX=$HOME` to your shell initialization file.

Additionally, consider third-party installer [n-install](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install), which allows installation directly from GitHub; for instance,

    curl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash

sets both `PREFIX` and `N_PREFIX` to `$HOME/n`, installs `n` to `$HOME/n/bin`, modifies the initialization files of supported shells to export `N_PREFIX` and add `$HOME/n/bin` to the `PATH`, and installs the latest stable `node` version.


As a result, both `n` itself and all `node` versions it manages are hosted inside a single, optionally configurable directory, which you can later remove with the included `n-uninstall` script. `n-update` updates `n` itself to the latest version. See the [n-install repo](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install) for more details.

### Installing/Activating Versions

Simply execute `n <version>` to install a version of `node`. If `<version>` has already been installed (via `n`), `n` will activate that version.

    $ n 0.8.14
    $ n 0.8.17
    $ n 0.9.6

Execute `n` on its own to view your currently installed versions. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate and press enter or the right arrow key to select. Use ^C (control + C) to exit the selection screen.
If you like vim key bindings during the selection of node versions, you can use `j` and `k` to navigate up or down without using arrows. 

    $ n

      0.8.14
    ο 0.8.17
      0.9.6

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ n latest

Use or install the stable official release:

    $ n stable

Use or install the latest LTS official release:

    $ n lts

### Removing Versions

Remove some versions:

    $ n rm 0.9.4 v0.10.0

Alternatively, you can use `-` in lieu of `rm`:

    $ n - 0.9.4

Removing all versions except the current version:

```bash
$ n prune 
```

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of `node`, we can target
them directly by asking `n` for the binary path:

    $ n bin 0.9.4
    /usr/local/n/versions/0.9.4/bin/node

Or by using a specific version through `n`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ n use 0.9.4 some.js

Flags also work here:

    $ n as 0.9.4 --debug some.js

### Working with `npm`

A node install normally includes npm as well, which might be a downgrade if you have upgraded npm separately. You can preserve your current npm and exclude it from the install:

    $ n --preserve-npm 6.1.0

After switching Node.js versions using `n`, `npm` may not work properly. This should fix it (thanks [@mikemoser](https://github.com/mikemoser)!):

```sh
$ curl -0 -L https://npmjs.com/install.sh | sudo sh
```

`sudo` may not be required depending on your system configuration.

## Custom source

If you would like to use a project other than the official Node.js or io.js projects, you can use the special `n project [command]` which allows you to control the behavior of `n` using environment variables.

For example, to grab the latest io.js version but name it "foo" instead,

      PROJECT_NAME="foo" PROJECT_URL="https://iojs.org/dist/" n project latest

Required Variables:

* `PROJECT_NAME`: The name the project will be stored under
* `PROJECT_URL`: The location to download the project from. Note, this must follow the same format as the io.js/Node.js repos

Optional Variables:

* `HTTP_USER`: The username if the `PROJECT_URL` is protected by basic authentication
* `HTTP_PASSWORD`: The password if the `PROJECT_URL` is protected by basic authentication
* `PROJECT_VERSION_CHECK`: Many custom projects keep the same version number as the Node.js release they are based on, and maintain their own separate version in process. This allows you to define a JavaScript variable that will be used to check for the version of the process, for example: `process.versions.node`

## Custom architecture

By default `n` picks the binaries matching your system architecture, e.g. `n` will download 64 bit binaries for a 64 bit system. You can override this by using the `-a` or `--arch` option.

Download and use latest 32 bit version of `node`:

    $ n --arch x86 latest

Download and use latest 32 bit version of `iojs`:

    $ n io --arch x86 latest

Download and use 64 bit LTS version of `node` for older Mac Intel Core 2 Duo systems (x86 image is no longer available but x64 runs fine):

    $ n --arch x64 lts

## Additional Details

`n` installs versions to `/usr/local/n/versions` by default. Here, it can see what versions are currently installed and activate previously installed versions accordingly when `n <version>` is invoked again.

Activated versions are then installed to the prefix `/usr/local`, which may be altered via the __`N_PREFIX`__ environment variable.

To alter where `n` operates, simply `export N_PREFIX`.

`n` does not work on Windows at the moment. Pull Requests are appreciated.

If you are searching for the latest version of `n` below 2.x.x, check out the branch `1.x.x`.
