# n

Simple flavour of node binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

## Installation

    $ npm install -g n

or

    $ make install

### Installing Binaries

Install a few nodes:

    $ n 0.8.14
    $ n 0.8.17
    $ n 0.9.6

Type `n` to prompt selection of an installed node. Use the up /
down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to
select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ n

      0.8.14
    Î¿ 0.8.17
      0.9.6

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ n latest

Use or install the stable official release:

    $ n stable

Switch to the previous version you were using:

    $ n prev

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ n rm 0.9.4 v0.10.0

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ n - 0.9.4

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of node, we can target
them directly by asking `n` for the binary path:

    $ n bin 0.9.4
    /usr/local/n/versions/0.9.4/bin/node

Or by using a specific version through `n`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ n use 0.9.4 some.js

with flags:

    $ n as 0.9.4 --debug some.js

## Usage

 Output from `n --help`:

    Usage: n [options] [COMMAND] [args]

    Commands:

      n                            Output versions installed
      n latest                     Install or activate the latest node release
      n stable                     Install or activate the latest stable node release
      n <version>                  Install node <version>
      n use <version> [args ...]   Execute node <version> with [args ...]
      n bin <version>              Output bin path for <version>
      n rm <version ...>           Remove the given version(s)
      n --latest                   Output the latest node version available
      n --stable                   Output the latest stable node version available
      n ls                         Output the versions of node available

    Options:

      -V, --version   Output current version of n
      -h, --help      Display help information

    Aliases:

      which   bin
      use     as
      list    ls
      -       rm

## Details

 `n` by default installs node to _/usr/local/n/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of node when `n <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated nodes are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which of course may be altered via the __N_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `n` operates simply export __N_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
