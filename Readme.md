Simple flavour of node/iojs binary management, no subshells, no profile setup, no convoluted api, just _simple_.

*Note: Works on Windows if you're using MinGW/MSYS. See [Windows Installation] for more information.* 
*Pull Requests are appreciated.*
*If you are searching for the latest version below 2.x.x, check out the branch "1.x.x"*

## Installation

With node/iojs already installed:

    $ npm install -g n

or, by cloning this repo and running:

    $ make install

to install `n` to subdirectory `bin/n` of the directory specified in environment variable `PREFIX`, which defaults to `/usr/local` (note that you will likely need `sudo` to install there).  
To change the default to, say, `$HOME`, i.e., to install `n` to `$HOME/bin/n`, run `PREFIX=$HOME make install`.  

Once installed, `n` downloads node/iojs versions to subdirectory `n/versions` of the directory specified in environment variable `N_PREFIX`, which defaults to `/usr/local`; the _active_ node/iojs version is installed directly in `N_PREFIX`.  
To change the default to, say, `$HOME`, prefix later calls to `n` with `N_PREFIX=$HOME ` or add `export N_PREFIX=$HOME` to your shell initialization file.

Alternatively, consider third-party installer [n-install](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install), which allows installation directly from GitHub; for instance,

    curl -L http://git.io/n-install | bash

sets both `PREFIX` and `N_PREFIX` to `$HOME/n`, installs `n` to `$HOME/n/bin`, modifies the initialization files of supported shells to export `N_PREFIX` and add `$HOME/n/bin` to the `PATH`, and installs the latest stable node version.  
As a result, both `n` itself and all node/iojs versions it manages are hosted inside a single, optionally configurable directory, which you can later remove with the included `n-uninstall` script; script `n-update` updates `n` itself to the latest version - see the [n-install repo](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install) for details.

### Windows Installation
Because node does not package npm with the node executable, npm is not versioned by n on Windows. This has only been tested to work with MinGW/MSYS, which is what [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) uses. To use n on Windows:

1. Install node/iojs and npm
2. Run npm install -g n
3. Set N_PREFIX to a writeable directory (~/n is a good choice)
4. (Optional) Add `export N_PREFIX=~/n` to ~/.bashrc (/Users/YourUserName/.bashrc)
5. Add the directory defined above to your Windows Path. IMPORTANT: This path should come before your global node installation. Your PATH should look something like: ...;C:\Users\MyUser\n;...;C:\Program Files\nodejs\bin
6. Continue to the Installing Binaries section below.

### Installing Binaries

Install a few nodes:

    $ n 0.8.14
    $ n 0.8.17
    $ n 0.9.6

Type `n` to prompt selection of an installed node. Use the up /
down arrow to navigate, and press enter or the right arrow to
select, or ^C to cancel:

    $ n

      0.8.14
    Î¿ 0.8.17
      0.9.6

Use or install the latest official release:

    $ n latest

Use or install the stable official release:

    $ n stable

Use or install the latest LTS official release:

    $ n lts

### Removing Binaries

Remove some versions:

    $ n rm 0.9.4 v0.10.0

Instead of using `rm` we can simply use `-`:

    $ n - 0.9.4

### Binary Usage

When running multiple versions of node, we can target
them directly by asking `n` for the binary path:

    $ n bin 0.9.4
    /usr/local/n/versions/0.9.4/bin/node

Or by using a specific version through `n`'s `use` sub-command:

    $ n use 0.9.4 some.js

with flags:

    $ n as 0.9.4 --debug some.js

## Usage

      -       rm

## Custom source

If you would like to use a project other than the official Node.js or io.js projects, you can use the special `n project [command]` which allows you to control the behavior of `n` using environment variables.

Example:

To grab the latest io.js version but name it "foo" instead,

      PROJECT_NAME="foo" PROJECT_URL="https://iojs.org/dist/" n project latest

Required Variables:

* `PROJECT_NAME`: The name the project will be stored under
* `PROJECT_URL`: The location to download the project from. Note, this must follow the same format as the io.js/Node.js repos

Optional Variables:

* `HTTP_USER`: The username if the `PROJECT_URL` is protected by basic authentication
* `HTTP_PASSWORD`: The password if the `PROJECT_URL` is protected by basic authentication
* `PROJECT_VERSION_CHECK`: Many custom projects keep the same version number as the Node.js release they are based on, and maintain their own separate version in process. This allows you to define a JavaScript variable that will be used to check for the version of the process, for example: `process.versions.node`

## Custom architecture

By default `n` picks the binaries matching your system architecture, e.g. `n` will download 64 bit binaries for a 64 bit system. You can override this by using the `-a` or `--arch` option.

Download and use latest 32 bit version of node:

    $ n --arch x86 latest

Download and use latest 32 bit version of iojs:

    $ n io --arch x86 latest


## Details

 `n` by default installs node to _/usr/local/n/versions_, from
 which it can see what you have currently installed, and activate previously installed versions of node when `n <version>` is invoked again.

 Activated nodes are then installed to the prefix _/usr/local_, which of course may be altered via the __N_PREFIX__ environment variable.

 To alter where `n` operates simply export __N_PREFIX__ to whatever you prefer.
